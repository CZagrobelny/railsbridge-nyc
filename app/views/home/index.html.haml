        %h1 About RailsBridge NYC
        %p
          RailsBridge is an organization that works to increase
          diversity in tech by putting on a variety of awesome
          free events.
        %p
          We hold free 1.5 day Workshops in the New York City
          area to help women learn how to program their first
          websites in Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
